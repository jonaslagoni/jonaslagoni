## Tooling
Here are all the tools I am doing some kind of maintenance on;

- <a href="https://github.com/the-codegen-project/cli">The Codegen Project CLI</a> - the next-gen code generator that easily can be integrated into any project (regardless of language) that simplifies the implementation and testing phase.
- <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/modelina">Modelina</a> - A library I started with <a href="https://github.com/magicmatatjahu">Maciej</a> for generating models from various inputs (AsyncAPI, OpenAPI, JSON Schema, TypeScript models, etc) into various outputs (TypeScript, C#, Python, etc). Try it here <a href="https://modelina.org/playground">modelina.org/playground</a>.
- <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/EDAVisualiser">EDAVisualiser</a> - A visualization tool for simple and complex systems, which supports all the major design frameworks, React, Next, Vue, Angular, etc. Try it here <a href="https://asyncapi.github.io/EDAVisualiser">asyncapi.github.io/EDAVisualiser</a>.
- <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">React SDK</a> - A contender to Nunjucks to generate anything from templates while enabling easy debugging and testing. Read more here <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/tools/generator/react-render-engine">asyncapi.com/docs/tools/generator/react-render-engine</a>.
- <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js">AsyncAPI JS/TS Parser</a> - Enable easy interaction with AsyncAPI documents and give a production-level abstraction so you don't have to change your implementation when new AsyncAPI versions get released. 
- <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">AsyncAPI Generator</a> - can generate anything from AsyncAPI using templates.
- <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/converter-js">AsyncAPI Converter</a> - can convert to AsyncAPI from OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and upgrade when new AsyncAPI versions occur.
- <a href="https://github.com/jonaslagoni/gh-action-dotnet-bump">GH Action for bumping .NET versions</a> - Automatically bump .NET/C# version of libraries, by following semantic release.
- <a href="https://github.com/jonaslagoni/gh-action-asyncapi-document-bump">GH Action for bumping AsyncAPI documents</a> - Automatically bump the application version for AsyncAPI documents by following semantic release.
- <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/spec-json-schemas">AsyncAPI JSON Schema collection</a> - The collection of JSON Schema documents that can validate all AsyncAPI versions, while still being maintainable through bundling, testing, and linting.

## Writings
I am using [eventstack.tech/posts](https://eventstack.tech/posts) as my personal sanctuary for writing stuff about projects, updates, and different tech stuff, but can also be found in the wild.

Here is an overview of the subjects so far:
- Automated code generation ([introduction](https://eventstack.tech/posts/automated-utopia), [versioning](https://eventstack.tech/posts/automated-utopia-versioning), for [TypeScript libraries](https://eventstack.tech/posts/automated-utopia-typescript), for [.NET libraries](https://eventstack.tech/posts/automated-utopia-dotnet))
- AsyncAPI Governance ([getting started](https://eventstack.tech/posts/getting-started-with-governance), in practice [part 1](https://eventstack.tech/posts/enforcing-consistency-guidelines-part-1), [part 2](https://eventstack.tech/posts/enforcing-consistency-guidelines-part-2))
- API versioning ([theory](https://eventstack.tech/posts/versioning-is-easy), [in practice](https://eventstack.tech/posts/asyncapi-versioning-in-practice))
- [Reusability in AsyncAPI causing problems](https://eventstack.tech/posts/reusability-causing-problems)
