## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Is this a CV? Logbook? Highlights? Maybe a bit of all. Currently hired by Postman, as part of their <a href="https://blog.postman.com/announcing-postman-open-technologies/">Open Technologies Team</a>, as a Lead Software Engineer working on <a href="https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi">AsyncAPI</a> full time.

# These are the projects I am working on ðŸ”­

     alt="AsyncAPI logo"/> While it is my day job, this is my spare-time project as well and is my main focus at the moment. I am part of the <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc">AsyncAPI Technical Steering Committee</a> and maintain a bunch of tools. I am/was also the release coordinator for AsyncAPI 3.0.0, so know my way around all repositories within the organization.

# Tooling
Here are all the tools I am actively maintaining regardless of what my day job is.

     alt="Modelina banner"/><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/modelina">Modelina</a> is a library I started with <a href="https://github.com/magicmatatjahu">Maciej</a>, which is for generating models from various inputs (AsyncAPI, OpenAPI, JSON Schema, TypeScript models, etc) into various outputs (TypeScript, C#, Python, etc) in a highly customizable, and extendable. It is built to support different serialization libraries (XML, JSON, bytes, etc) so you can adapt the models directly to your need. </br></br> Try the playground here: <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/modelina">asyncapi.com/modelina</a></br> Find a bunch of examples here: <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/modelina/tree/master/examples#examples">modelina examples</a>

It can also be a complex system comprised of multiple applications. It allows this through something called <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/EDAVisualiser#views">views</a>. It of course supports all the major design frameworks, React, Next, Vue, Angular, etc.</br></br> Try the playground here: <a href="asyncapi.github.io/EDAVisualiser">asyncapi.github.io/EDAVisualiser</a>

## Writings
I am using [eventstack.tech/posts](https://eventstack.tech/posts) as my personal sanctuary for writing stuff about the projects, updates, and different tech stuff.

Here is an overview of the subjects so far:
- Automated code generation ([introduction](https://eventstack.tech/posts/automated-utopia), [versioning](https://eventstack.tech/posts/automated-utopia-versioning), for [TypeScript libraries](https://eventstack.tech/posts/automated-utopia-typescript), for [.NET libraries](https://eventstack.tech/posts/automated-utopia-dotnet))
- AsyncAPI Governance ([getting started](https://eventstack.tech/posts/getting-started-with-governance), in practice [part 1](https://eventstack.tech/posts/enforcing-consistency-guidelines-part-1), [part 2](https://eventstack.tech/posts/enforcing-consistency-guidelines-part-2))
- API versioning ([theory](https://eventstack.tech/posts/versioning-is-easy), [in practice](https://eventstack.tech/posts/asyncapi-versioning-in-practice))
- [Reusability in AsyncAPI causing problems](https://eventstack.tech/posts/reusability-causing-problems)
- AsyncAPI tooling updates (week [30](https://eventstack.tech/posts/asyncapi-tooling-update-1), [33](https://eventstack.tech/posts/asyncapi-tooling-update-week-33), [39](https://eventstack.tech/posts/asyncapi-tooling-update-week-39), [46](https://eventstack.tech/posts/asyncapi-tooling-update-week-46))
