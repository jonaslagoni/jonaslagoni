      <h1><a href="https://github.com/GamingAPI/">GamingAPI</a></h1><p><a href="https://gamingapi.org/">GamingAPI.org</a> is a side project of mine where I try to use everything from AsyncAPI (tooling and spec) and incorporate it into a standard for interacting with all types of game servers (focus on <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/">Rust</a>, upcoming Minecraft, etc.) through generated SDK's, documentation, governance, and more!</p>

I am part of the <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc">AsyncAPI Technical Steering Committee</a>, release coordinator for v3, and maintainer and creator of a bunch of the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/repositories">open source tools</a> such as;</br>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/EDAVisualiser/">EDAVisualiser</a> a visualization tool for simple and complex systems, which support all the major design frameworks, React, Next, Vue, Angular, etc. Try it here <a href="https://asyncapi.github.io/EDAVisualiser">asyncapi.github.io/EDAVisualiser</a></li>

# Tooling
Here are all the tools I am actively maintaining;

- <h5>GH Action for bumping .NET versions</h5> <a href="https://github.com/jonaslagoni/gh-action-dotnet-bump">Automatically bump .NET/C# version</a> of libraries, by following semantic release.
- <h5>GH Action for bumping AsyncAPI documents</h5> <a href="https://github.com/jonaslagoni/gh-action-asyncapi-document-bump">Automatically bump the application version for AsyncAPI documents</a> by following semantic release.

<details>
  <summary>Here is a list of all the previous libraries and projects I have worked on.</summary>

- https://github.com/jonaslagoni/Wizard-Of-Treldan, university group project, 2d and 2 different UI games in one, with a custom game engine, written in Java.
- https://github.com/jonaslagoni/NEON, university group project, a 2d tower defense game, using OSGi to use a modular system to load and unload towers, maps, game modes, etc on the fly, build upon libgdx, written in Java.
- https://github.com/jonaslagoni/csgoLiveServer, spare time project trying to reflect what happens in a CSGO server in the web browser, first version of GamingAPI I guess.
- https://github.com/jonaslagoni/asyncapi-quicktype-template, AsyncAPI generator template to generate typed models with QuickType. 
- https://github.com/jonaslagoni/asyncapi-quicktype-filter, the core library code for the QuickType template.

## Writings
I am using [eventstack.tech/posts](https://eventstack.tech/posts) as my personal sanctuary for writing stuff about projects, updates, and different tech stuff.

Here is an overview of the subjects so far:
- Automated code generation ([introduction](https://eventstack.tech/posts/automated-utopia), [versioning](https://eventstack.tech/posts/automated-utopia-versioning), for [TypeScript libraries](https://eventstack.tech/posts/automated-utopia-typescript), for [.NET libraries](https://eventstack.tech/posts/automated-utopia-dotnet))
- AsyncAPI Governance ([getting started](https://eventstack.tech/posts/getting-started-with-governance), in practice [part 1](https://eventstack.tech/posts/enforcing-consistency-guidelines-part-1), [part 2](https://eventstack.tech/posts/enforcing-consistency-guidelines-part-2))
- API versioning ([theory](https://eventstack.tech/posts/versioning-is-easy), [in practice](https://eventstack.tech/posts/asyncapi-versioning-in-practice))
- [Reusability in AsyncAPI causing problems](https://eventstack.tech/posts/reusability-causing-problems)
- AsyncAPI tooling updates (week [30](https://eventstack.tech/posts/asyncapi-tooling-update-1), [33](https://eventstack.tech/posts/asyncapi-tooling-update-week-33), [39](https://eventstack.tech/posts/asyncapi-tooling-update-week-39), [46](https://eventstack.tech/posts/asyncapi-tooling-update-week-46))
